# CSS Visual Cues
## Background
Visual Cues emphasizes the importance of CSS styling for user interaction and experience.

## Wireframes
This will be a one-page web application. It contains nav links to different sections within the application itself as well as my own GitHub and LinkedIn accounts.

Each section of the web application will feature a different CSS styling technique. It will compare and contrast unstyled and styled elements to emphasize the impact styling can have on UI/UX. Some textual information on these effects will also be placed underneath each example.
