# CSS Visual Cues
## Background
Visual Cues emphasizes the importance of CSS styling for user interaction and experience.

The project will compare plain, un-styled elements with CSS styled elements to illustrate how visual cues can greatly enhance the ergonomics of a web service. The use of side-by-side visual demonstrations as well as a brief text descriptions of the effects each styled element has on a user will be the main feature of this application.

## Functionality & MVP
With CSS Visual Cues, user will be able to compare/contrast:
- [x] Icon Hover Effects
  - [x] Wobble
  - [x] Rotate
  - [X] Hang
  - [x] Float
  - [x] Grow
  - [x] Push
- [ ] Button Effects (2x)
  - [ ] Pressed Effect
  - [ ] Hover Effect
- [ ] Transition Effects (2x)
  - [x] Flip
  - [x] Slide
- [x] 3D Cube

## Wireframes
This will be a one-page web application. It contains nav links to different sections within the application itself as well as my own GitHub and LinkedIn accounts.

Each section of the web application will feature a different CSS styling technique. It will compare and contrast unstyled and styled elements to emphasize the impact styling can have on UI/UX. Some textual information on these effects will also be placed underneath each example.

After more practical examples of CSS styling, I will also include a section on the power of CSS which displays how one can use CSS to create and manipulate 3D Cubes.
